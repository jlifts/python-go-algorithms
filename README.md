# Grokking Algorithms

This is inspired by reading through the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/ref=sr_1_1?crid=21QOB7SB0A1DT&dchild=1&keywords=grokking+algorithm&qid=1627911046&sprefix=grokking%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-1) by Aditya Y. Bhargava

These are based on examples out of the book and either the same examples or ones applied to organizing data (top 100 babies first names, boys).

I did my best to refactor the <b>Python</b> algorithms in the book to <b>Golang</b> for pracice.
